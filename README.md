# ANa

A(rgo) Na(vis) is an experimental, semi-autonomous agent which can be prompted with a task, collaboratively  create a plan to complete that task and finally, execute that plan.

## Goals & Inspiration

ANa was inspired by other autonomous agent projects like AutoGPT and CrewAI and is an attempt at building a  fully open sourced agent that can be improved and expanded by the community. With your help ANa can become an agent that is capable of achieving increasingly complex objectives and serve as an assistant to aid with as many digital tasks as the community can build support for. 
    
## Contributing

In keeping with our stated goals, all contributions are welcome. You are encouraged to contribute not to just say that you've contributed to open source but to help in building something that will be amazing and useful for everyone. Ultimately, the hope is that ANa is easy to understand and extend, so anything that helps in getting there is greatly appreciated. From adding new integrations and refactoring application logic to writing clear and understandable documentation and tests, anything that can make ANa an amazing and reliable tool is a welcome contribution.
