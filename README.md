# ANa

A(rgo) Na(vis) is an experimental autonomous agent which can be prompted with a task and execute it

## Development 

If you are seeking to participate in the development of ANa, I'd recommend installing docker first. Once docker is installed and configured for your machine, you can navigate to the base directory of the project and run the `env` script. This will spin up a developmet container with all the dependencies needed to do development for ANa and will configure the ANa CLI on the main path.
